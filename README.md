## Some technical highlights:
- Used an object-oriented approach where each node is placed within a hierarchy. Followed the best practice: parent nodes call methods on child nodes, and child nodes emit signals which may be caught by parent nodes.
- Combined inheritence (e.g. when designing states for the enemy AI's state machine) and composition (e.g. when implementing health bars and hitboxes across several entities).
- Enemy slime AI follows a state machine which navigates between an idle wander, chasing the player, and attacking the player.
- Animated sprites and level layouts were implemented using sprite sheets and tile maps.
- Hitboxes were used for body collisions and attack ranges.
